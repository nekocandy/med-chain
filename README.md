# Inspiration 💡

Hospitals nowadays tend to take no accountability for their actions in situations that they are held responsible. Among many, bad reviews are manipulated constantly by such big name and no name hospitals alike to maintain their reputation. Another such situation also involves constant fraudulent charges on the patient, which are made to earn profits off of the patient. To tackle such problems, we came up with Med-Chain, a Flow blockchain based web3 leveraged medical centric platform to empower the right to medication!

We also went ahead with Web3 technology for this particularly, since the origins of blockchain technology and has still been in hindsight limited to monetary and gaming platforms - which is not the case now, there are much more amazing use cases including such cases where the issues are more focused on health care problems, social problems and dealing of legal issues. Hence, we thank Flow to allow us to be able to leverage their platform for the right cause.

# What it does
- Our platform aims to make it transparent and easy for the healthcare industry to trust each other.
- We are proud of the quality of the smart contracts we made on the FLOW blockchain using Cadence.
- Our Platform can:
	1. Medicines:
		- Register any data related to medicines on the FLOW Blockchain
		- We can scan the QR code, which shall get all information about the medicine from the FLOW blockchain.

	2. Bills on Blockchain
		- As we mentioned, some hospitals try to take advantage of patients, to solve it, we have created a billing service which shall:
			- Generate the Bill
			- Store in on FLOW Blockchain
			- Send an email to the patient with the Transaction ID and payment URL
			- Payment is accepted in FLOW tokens
			- When user makes payment:
				- It shall store the payment transaction ID into the data for future proof

	3. Doctors:
		- Doctors can register themselves on the platform
		- Registration data would be stored on blockchain
		- After a doctor has been registered, Patients can review the doctor
		- The reviews are stored on the chain, and the smart contract contains no code to manipulate the data, FLOW has provided with a lot of safety features to prevent something like this from happening.
		- This would add another layer of trust between doctors and patients

	4. Donation:
		- People can make donation to the hospitals
		- We can donate FLOW tokens
		- Hospitals would transparently use these donations to

# How we built it
- We have used FLOW Blockchain to build it, at the backend, we are using tRPC, and for authentication and database, we do not use anything else, we are relying entirely on FLOW, that's how incredible FLOW is.

# Challenges we ran into
 - One of the major challenges was to ensure inclusion of all necessary
   ✅ and additional features ➕, gathering every possible resource, ensuring that none of the features were in any way misleading, etc.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of
Here are some of the awesome accomplishments of our team 🌻:

 - Achieved all in a time crunch ⚡️- We nailed it despite having just a weekend, plus staying up all night to complete the hackathon! 🏁 Our time management skills were on point, and we made every second count to deliver this 🚀
 - Purpose-driven  ❤️ - We built a project that's close to our hearts! 💪 Our solution is all about making a positive impact, and we're stoked to have created something meaningful 🌍
 - Learning new tools 🔧 - We learned and used a bunch of new tools like pros, we went through the candence v1 documentation, just to be prepared in case they deploy it to testnet  this weekend, and our contracts break 😅, which fortunately didn't happen
 - Functional  🚀 -  Despite the time crunch, our project came to life with a functional prototype that  is beneficial to all 🤗

# What we learned

 - Though we were able to complete the project almost on time ⌚️ we
   understood how important time management is when hacking! Requirement
   gathering 🔨 for our purpose was pretty challenging, since we wanted
   to make a holistic 💬 yet easy-to-understand and intuitive 💭 website.
 - The coordination 🤝 among us improved significantly, along with it,
   we realized how powerful ⭐️ of an impact we can make when we
   collaborate well.

# What's next?
 - We wish to add some kind of inventory management which shall ease the load off the Management, and also help maintain transparency
